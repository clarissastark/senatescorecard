**The Senate Scoredcard**

The Senate Scoredcard is a web app that will be a hub for nonprofit scorecards.

The politicians and quotes feed into a quiz that pulls a random quote and politician from the database and asks the user to guess if the quote matches the person.

**Installation Instructions**

Clone this repository to your local computer, run npm install, and then npm start in your CLI to access a version of the site.

**Technologies Used**

The Senate Scoredcard is a MEAN stack app. I utilized flexbox patterns for most of the CSS.

**Approach Taken**

The idea behind The Senate Scoredcard is to update nonprofit scorecards for the modern day and make a hub for users where they can add their own reviews and, more like a Yelp for our legislative leaders. Ultimately, I hope to combine data from several different non-profit scorecards to create a full picture for each Member of Congress.

**Unsolved Problems**

Angular local logins aren't working, although the Express routes function.  Facebook and Twitter logins are also not funcitonal presently. As such, reviews aren't tied to users.

The review box also doesn't clear when a review is submitted. 

**Future Updates**

I would like to add a rating system similar to Yelp. I'd like add a section for Senate candidates as a resource for users during election season.

I would also like to use d3 to display individual senators' votes for and against different topic areas.
