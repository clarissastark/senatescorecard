***THIS APP***

*THIS APP* is a web app for both the politically savvy and un-savvy. Site visitors are able to add quotes and politicians to the database and vote on quotes that they agree and disagree with.

The politicians and quotes feed into a quiz that pulls a random quote and politician from the database and asks the user to guess if the quote matches the person.

**Installation Instructions**

Clone this repository to your local computer, run npm install, and then **npm start** in your CLI to access a version of the site.

**Technologies Used**
*THIS APP* is a Ruby on Rails application that uses postgresql as the database. I utilized bootstrap for most of the CSS.

**Approach Taken**

The idea behind *THIS APP* is to begin addressing the problem of America's low voter turnout and engagement through gamifying how well people know politicians and allowing people to voice their opinion on the things politicians say.

I started creating an ERD of politicians and quotes and realized that I wanted to add more interactivity by including a game. I started with the simpliest game idea I could think of, which was pulling one random quote and one random politician from the database.

If I were going to do it again, I might make the game "Bullshitting, or Not?" as I think it's way more fun for people to call out bullshit than getting facts right.

**Unsolved Problems**
